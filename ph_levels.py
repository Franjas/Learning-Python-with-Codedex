# Create a program that checks whether a pH level is basic, acidic, or neutral.

# First, create a variable called ph and ask the user for a value between 0 and 14.

# Write an if, elif, else statement that:

#    If ph is greater than 7, output "Basic".
#    If ph is less than 7, output "Acidic".
#    Else, output "Neutral".
# CodÃ©dex

elif ph < 7:
    print('Its ph level is Acidic')
